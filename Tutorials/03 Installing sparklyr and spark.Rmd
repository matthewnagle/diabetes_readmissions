First we will install sparklyr. This only needs to be done once.

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("sparklyr")
```

Next, load it up.

```{r echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(sparklyr)
```

What you need to do next depends on whether you are using your own machine or Noteable. Please follow the directions in the appropriate section below.

### Using Noteable

Run the following command in the Rstudio console to install Spark 3.2.2:

```{r eval = FALSE}
spark_install("3.2.3","3.2")
spark_installed_versions()
```

Installing spark only needs to be done once. You will notice a new folder called spark has been created in your working directory.


### Using your own  machine

Apache Spark requires Java. Spark version 2.x is compatible with Java 8, whereas
Spark version 3.x is compatible with Java 11. Therefore in order to determine which 
version of Spark to install, you should first see which if any version of 
Java is installed on your computer. 

To do this, use the following command in Rstudio:

```{r echo = TRUE, results = 'hide'}
system("java -version")
```

If the output is something like: java version "1.8.0_351", then you already 
have Java 8 installed. Note that the middle number between the full stops is the Java version on your computer. 

If you have some other version of Java installed, then you should install Java 8 
following the link above.

If you don't have Java installed, then follow this link to install Java 8: [https://www.java.com/en/download/](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

If you have Java 8 installed, then run the following command in the Rstudio console
to install Spark 2.4.3:

```{r eval = FALSE}
spark_install('2.4.3')
```

If you have Java 11 installed, run the following command in the Rstudio console 
to install Spark 3.2.2

```{r eval = FALSE}
spark_install("3.2.2","3.2")
```

Installing spark only needs to be done once.
