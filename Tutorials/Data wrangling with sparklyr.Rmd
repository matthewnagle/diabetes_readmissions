Welcome to this tutorial paired-programming practice document! 

In pairs, work through this document. A sample completed document is available on the tutorial github repository as well.


# Task 1 

Install the following packages if you do not already have them already, and load them with the `library()` function: 

* sparklyr 
* dplyr 
* ggplot2
* knitr 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# your code here
```


# Task 2

Create a spark connection that treats your local machine as a cluster. Load up the msleep dataset from the ggplot2 package, and put it into a Spark dataframe.

```{r}
sc = spark_connect(master = 'local')
msleep = copy_to(sc, msleep, overwrite = TRUE)
```


# Task 3

Which dplyr functions can be used to have a first look at the data? Run them.

```{r}
head(msleep)
glimpse(msleep)
```


# Task 4

Count the occurrence of all the different values for the order variable that are
present in the dataset. Use kable to display any tables.

```{r}
msleep %>%
  count(order) %>%
  kable()
```

# Task 5

Select the columns name, order and brainwt. Filter to only those rows where
the order variable is Primates. Finally, arrange the result by brainwt. 
Try to use the pipe operator %>% to cut down on how many lines of code you write.

```{r}
msleep %>%
  select(name, order, brainwt) %>%
  filter(order == 'Primates') %>%
  arrange(brainwt)
```


# Task 6

In this task, we will create a table of mean brain weight to body weight ratio,
grouped by the variable order.
Create a new column called brain_body_wt_ratio that is equal to brainwt/bodywt.
Group by the variable order, and then calculate the mean for each group.

```{r}
msleep %>%
  mutate(brain_body_wt_ratio = brainwt / bodywt) %>%
  group_by(order) %>%
  summarise(mean_brain_body_wt_ratio = mean(brain_body_wt_ratio))
  
```


# Task 7

The total number of missing values in each column can be viewed using the following code

```{r warning = FALSE}
msleep %>%
  summarise_all(~sum(as.integer(is.na(.)))) %>%
  kable()
```

Impute missing values for brainwt. Do this by creating a new column called
brainwt_imputed, where NA values are replaced with the mean value for brainwt.
Verify the result by displaying the head of a table with the columns name, 
brainwt and brainwt_imputed. You may find the ifelse or  functions
useful (Google them).

```{r}
msleep = msleep %>%
  mutate(
    brainwt_imputed = case_when(
      is.na(brainwt) ~ mean(brainwt),
      TRUE ~ brainwt))

msleep %>%
  select(name, brainwt, brainwt_imputed) %>%
  head()
```



# Task 8

Use collect() and ggplot to make a horizontal bar chart with order on the vertical axis and average sleep_total on the horizontal axis.
You may find geom_col from ggplot useful.

```{r}
# your code here
```
